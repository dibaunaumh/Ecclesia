Ecclesia
=========


Ecclesia is an application for helping organizations meet they're goals. It is developed to test various technologies that facilitate Direct Democracy, as part of the initiatives of the Israeli Movement for Direct Democracy (http://kol1.org/wiki).

The project is fully open-source & any testing/contribution is highly welcome.
